Below are summaries of the different examples and how they are intended to be used.
The nueral network potential example is meant to illustrate a typical usage of the code
to train a potential, including both input and basis files.
The 1D and 2D function examples are intended to illustrate how neural networks work in simpler
cases and to provide a proof of concept that the provided code does effectively train
neural networks.

**** Ar ****
Example of training a nueral network for ab-initio data of crystalline Ar.

**** gauss ****
Example of training a newtork to fit a Gaussian function.

**** gauss2D ****
Example of training a newtork to fit a 2D Gaussian function.

**** tanh *****
Example of training a network to fit a Tanh function.
